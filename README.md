# Adrian Mejia's Blog

The main objective is:

1. Reminder of how to do things in Software Engineering (e.g. learn briefly Angular, Node or CSS layout)
2. Experiment on new technology (doing and teaching is the best way to learn).
<!-- 3. Earn money: Attract users, grow newsletter, sell books, personal marketing. -->

# Media types

There are different kinds of "posts" on this site:

## Posts

Posts are the most basic unit. Present a single topic and 2 or 3 main ideas to support it. It has an introduction and conclusion.
They could be supported by a video.

## Tutorials

Tutorials They are composed about multiple posts related to a single topic.

## Books

## Snippets

Snippets are short posts. Usually quick problem-solution format. A daily "Today I Learn". Interesting tweets, pro tips...
e.g.

```
List available tasks:

npm run
gulp --tasks
grunt --help
rake -T
```
