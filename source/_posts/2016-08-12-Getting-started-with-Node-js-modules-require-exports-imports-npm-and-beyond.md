Getting started with Node.js modules: `require`, `exports`, `imports`, and beyond.

Modules are a crucial concept to understand Node.js projects. In this post, we cover Node modules: `require`, `exports` and, the future `import`.

<!-- more -->

Node modules allow you to write reusable code. You can nest them one inside another. Using the Node Package Manager (NPM), you can publish your modules and make them available to the community. Also, NPM enables you to reuse modules created by other developers.

> We are using Node 12.x for the examples and ES6+ syntax. However, the concepts are valid for any version.


In this section, we are going to cover how to create Node modules and each one of its components:

- Require
- Exports
- Module (module.exports vs. export)
- Import

## Require

`require` are used to consume modules. It allows you to include modules in your programs. You can add built-in core Node.js modules, community-based modules (`node_modules`), and local modules.

Let's say we want to read a file from the filesystem. Node has a core module called 'fs':

{% codeblock lang:js mark:1 %}
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('./file.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
  if(err) { throw err; }
  console.log('data: ', data);
});
{% endcodeblock %}

As you can see, we imported the "fs" module into our code. It allows us to use any function attached to it, like "readFile" and many others.

The `require` function will look for files in the following order:

1. **Built-in** core Node.js modules (like `fs`)
2. **NPM Modules**. It will look in the `node_modules` folder.
3. **Local Modules**. If the module name has a `./`, `/` or `../`, it will look for the directory/file in the given path. It matches the file extensions: `*.js`, `*.json`, `*.mjs`, `*.cjs`, `*.wasm` and `*.node`.

Let's now explain each in little more details with

### Built-in Modules

When you install node, it comes with many built-in modules. Node comes with batteries included ;)

Some of the most used core modules are:

- [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html): Allows you to manipulate (create/read/write) files and directories.
- [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html): utilities to work with files and directories paths.
- [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html): create HTTP servers and clients for web development.
- [url](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html): utilities for parsing URLs and extracting elements from it.

These you don't have to install it, you can import them and use them in your programs.

### NPM Modules

NPM modules are 3rd-party modules that you can use after you install them. To name a few:

- [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash): a collection of utility functions for manipulating arrays, objects, and strings.
- [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request): HTTP client simpler to use than the built-in `http` module.
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): HTTP server for building websites and API. Again, simpler to use than the built-in `http` module.

These you have to install them first, like this:

```
npm install express
```

and then you can reference them like built-in modules, but this time they are going to be served from the `node_modules` folder that contains all the 3rd-party libraries.

```js
const express = require('express');
```

### Creating your own Nodejs modules

If you can't find a built-in or 3rd-party library that does what you want, you will have to develop it yourself.
In the following sections, you are going to learn how to do that using `exports`.

## Exports

The `exports` keyword gives you the chance to "export" your objects and methods. Let's do an example:

```javascript circle.js
const PI = 3.14159265359;

exports.area = radius => (radius ** 2) * PI;
exports.circumference = radius => 2 * radius * PI;
```

In the code below, we are exporting the `area` and `circumference` functions. We defined the `PI` constant, but this is only accessible within the module. Only the elements associated with `exports` are available outside the module.

So, we can consume it using `require` in another file like follows:

```javascript main.js
const circle = require('./circle');

const r = 3;
console.log(`Circle with radius ${r} has
  area: ${circle.area(r)};
  circumference: ${circle.circumference(r)}`);
```

Noticed that this time we prefix the module name with `./`. That indicates that the module is a local file.

## Module Wrapper

You can think of each Node.js module as a self-contained function like the following one:

```javascript Module Wrapper
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  module.exports = exports = {};

  // Your module code ...

});
```

We have already covered `exports` and `require`. Notice the relationship between `module.exports` and `exports`. They point to the same reference. But, if you assign something directly to `exports` you will break its link to `module.exports` â€” more on that in the next section.

For our convenience `__filename` and `__dirname` are defined. They provide the full path to the current file and directory. The latter excludes the filename and prints out the directory path.

For instance, for our `./circle.js` module, it would be something like this:

- `__filename`: `/User/adrian/code/circle.js`

- `__dirname`: `/User/adrian/code`

Ok, we have covered `exports`, `require`, `__filename`, and `__dirname`. The only one we haven't covered is `module`. Let's go for it!

## Module.exports vs. Exports

The `module` is not global; it is local for each module. It contains metadata about a module like id, exports, parent, children, and so on.

`exports` is an alias of `module.exports`. Consequently, whatever you assign to `exports` is also available on `module.exports`. However, if you assign something directly to exports, then you lose the shortcut to `module.exports`. E.g.

```javascript cat.js
class Cat {
  makeSound() {
    return `${this.constructor.name}: Meowww`;
  }
}

// exports = Cat; // It will not work with `new Cat();`
// exports.Cat = Cat; // It will require `new Cat.Cat();` to work (yuck!)
module.exports = Cat;
```

Try the following case with `exports` and then with `module.exports`.

``` javascript main.js
const Cat = require('./cat');

const cat = new Cat();
console.log(cat.makeSound());
```

To sum up, when to use `module.exports` vs `exports`:

Use `exports` to:

- Export named function. e.g. `exports.area`, `exports.circumference`.

Use `module.exports` to:

1. If you want to export an object, class, function at the root level (e.g. `module.exports = Cat`)

2. If you prefer to return a single object that exposes multiple assignments. e.g.`module.exports = {area, circumference};`


## Imports

Starting with version 8.5.0+, Node.js supports ES modules natively with a feature flag and new file extension `*.mjs`.

For instance, our previous `circle.js` can be rewritten as `circle.mjs` as follows:

```javascript circle.mjs
const PI = 3.14159265359;

export function area(radius) {
  return (radius ** 2) * PI;
}

export function circumference(radius) {
  return 2 * radius * PI;
}
```

Then, we can use import:

```javascript main.mjs
import { area, circumference } from './circle.mjs';

const r = 3;

console.log(`Circle with radius ${r} has
  area: ${area(r)};
  circunference: ${circumference(r)}`);
```

And, finally you can run it using the experimental module feature flag:

```bash
node --experimental-modules main.mjs
```

If you don't like experimental modules, another alternative is to use a transpiler. That converts modern JavaScript to older versions for you. Good options are
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html),
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs), and
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en#importing).

### Troubleshooting `import` and `require` issues

#### Experimental Flag
If you don't use the experimental flag `node --experimental-modules` and you try to use `import` you will get an error like this:

```
internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:819
  throw new ERR_REQUIRE_ESM(filename);
  ^

Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: Must use import to load ES Module: bla bla blah
```

#### File extension .mjs vs .js (or .cjs)

If you have a `*.mjs` file you cannot use `require` or it will throw an error (`ReferenceError: require is not defined`).
`.mjs` is for `import` ECMAScript Modules and `.js` is for regular `require` modules.

However, with `*.mjs` you can load both kinds of modules!

```js
import { area, circumference } from './circle.mjs';
import Cat from './cat.js';

const r = 3;
console.log(`Circle with radius ${r} has
  area: ${area(r)};
  circumference: ${circumference(r)}`);

const cat = new Cat();
console.log(cat.makeSound());
```

Notice that `cat.js` is using commonJS modules.

## Summary

We learned about how to create Node.js modules and used it in our code.  Modules allow us to reuse code easily. They provide functionality that is isolated from other modules. The `require` function is used to load modules. The `exports` and `module.exports` allow us to define what parts of our code we want to expose. We also explored the difference between `module.exports` and `exports`. Finally, we took a quick pick about what's coming up for modules using `imports`.
