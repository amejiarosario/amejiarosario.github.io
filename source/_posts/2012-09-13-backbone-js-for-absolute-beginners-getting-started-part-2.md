## Todo App in Backbone

After completing this example app, you will have experience and a basic understanding of Backbone modules!

(Updated: 2013-02-02, 2013-11-24)
*Notice*: This tutorial was written using Backbone v.0.9.x, now version 1.1.x or later are out. However, all the principles explained here apply to both.

**Todo app Boilerplate**

Let's start again with the initial [HTML file](https://raw.github.com/amejiarosario/Backbone-tutorial/439ff34409dfc01adca7f9f96efcd726295f1aac/backbone-tutorial.html) used on 1.1. Now, instead of div#container let's add the following HTML code:

{% codeblock HTML Structure lang:html https://raw.github.com/amejiarosario/Backbone-tutorial/fe0efb0fd0c4c3c4cb5fd61e9917165082f9a562/backbone-tutorial.html Full Code %}

  <section id="todoapp">
    <header id="header">
      <h1>Todos</h1>
      <input id="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?">
    </header>
    <section id="main">
      <ul id="todo-list"></ul>
    </section>
  </section>

{% endcodeblock %}

We will implement a Todo list, basically an unordered list (ul) of elements with checkboxes.

## Backbone.Model

Models are the heart of every application. It contains the interactive data and the logic surrounding it, such as data validation, getters and setters, default values, data initialization, conversions, etc.
For our example, we are going to create a model called `Todo`, which will store a string of text (title) and whether the task has been completed or not.

{% codeblock Todo Model lang:js https://raw.github.com/amejiarosario/Backbone-tutorial/fe0efb0fd0c4c3c4cb5fd61e9917165082f9a562/backbone-tutorial.html Full Code %}

    var app = {}; // create namespace for our app

    app.Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
      defaults: {
        title: '',
        completed: false
      }
    });

{% endcodeblock %}

Notice that by convention, class names are capitalized, while instance variables and objects are not. Another important aspect of models is that their properties are dynamic; they can be created on the fly and donâ€™t have any specific types associated with them.

**Test what you just coded!**

After you completed the code snippet above you can open your browser console (chrome's console: ctrl+shift+i -or- âŒ˜+alt+i) and try this out, to get familiar with the models:

{% codeblock Practice in your Browser\'s console  lang:js %}
var todo = new app.Todo({title: 'Learn Backbone.js', completed: false}); // create object with the attributes specified.
todo.get('title'); // "Learn Backbone.js"
todo.get('completed'); // false
todo.get('created_at'); // undefined
todo.set('created_at', Date());
todo.get('created_at'); // "Wed Sep 12 2012 12:51:17 GMT-0400 (EDT)"
{% endcodeblock %}

## Backbone.Collection

As its name indicates, collections are ordered sets of models. You can get and set models in the collection, listen for events when any element in the array changes, and fetch for modelâ€™s data from the server.

E.g.: `todoList.fetch();`


Collections allow to save data (in database, file, memory), and it requires a reference to it. Therefore, you need to specify the `url` parameter with a relative URL, where the modelâ€™s resource would be located on the server. Otherwise, you will get errors like:


`A "url" property or function must be specified`


We are not going to use a backend server for simplicity (I will do a new post for that); instead, we will use HTML5â€™s local storage for persistence through a Backboneâ€™s plugin. So, we need to define the localStorage property instead of the URL. You need to include the backbone-localstorage.js with the rest of your libs as [shown in the full code](https://raw.github.com/amejiarosario/Backbone-tutorial/fe0efb0fd0c4c3c4cb5fd61e9917165082f9a562/backbone-tutorial.html):

`<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/backbone-localstorage.js/1.0/backbone.localStorage-min.js" type="text/javascript">`

{% codeblock Todo list Collection lang:js https://raw.github.com/amejiarosario/Backbone-tutorial/fe0efb0fd0c4c3c4cb5fd61e9917165082f9a562/backbone-tutorial.html Full Code %}

    app.TodoList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
      model: app.Todo,
      localStorage: new Store("backbone-todo")
    });

    // instance of the Collection
    app.todoList = new app.TodoList();

{% endcodeblock %}

**Test what you just coded!**

(Google's Chrome console shortcuts: ctrl+shift+i -or- âŒ˜+alt+i)

{% codeblock Practice in your Browser\'s console  lang:js %}
var todoList = new app.TodoList()
todoList.create({title: 'Learn Backbone\'s Collection'}); // notice: that `completed` will be set to false by default.
var lmodel = new app.Todo({title: 'Learn Models', completed: true});
todoList.add(lmodel);
todoList.pluck('title');     // ["Learn Backbone's Collection", "Learn Models"]
todoList.pluck('completed'); // [false, true]
JSON.stringify(todoList);    // "[{"title":"Learn Backbone's Collection","completed":false,"id":"d9763e99-2267-75f5-62c3-9d7e40742aa6"},{"title":"Learn Models","completed":true}]"
{% endcodeblock %}


## Backbone.View

As mentioned in [1.2](/backbone-dot-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started/#1.2), Views doesnâ€™t have the HTML markups for our application, but instead (It's like the controller in MVC frameworks) process data and link it to templates. It finally render HTML based on events or data changes.

### Basic Properties

There are four basic properties in a view: el, initialize, render, and events.

We have already seen the first three and will see later the fourth one. Do you remember the Hello World View from [1.2](/backbone-dot-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started/#1.2)?

{% codeblock Example of a Backbone.View lang:js %}
    var AppView = Backbone.View.extend({
      // el - stands for element. Every view has a element associate in with HTML
      //      content will be rendered.
      el: '#container',
      // It's the first function called when this view it's instantiated.
      initialize: function(){
        this.render();
      },
      // $el - it's a cached jQuery object (el), in which you can use jQuery functions
      //       to push content. Like the Hello World in this case.
      render: function(){
        this.$el.html("Hello World");
      }
    });
{% endcodeblock %}


### `view.el`


Every view needs to reference a DOM at all times. Therefore, the view will inject content into this element. This is the `el` property. `this.el` is created from viewâ€™s `el`,`tagName`, `className`, `id` or `attributes` properties. If none of these are specified, then this.el is an empty `div`. The `view.$el` itâ€™s a cached jQuery object of the viewâ€™s element (view.el).


### Initialize/constructor


Here you can pass parameters that will be attached to a model, collection, or view.el.

### `render`

This function injects the markup into the elements. Not all views require having a render function. As you are going to see in the sample code, they can call other viewâ€™s render functions.

### delegated events

Events are written in the following format:

`{"<EVENT_TYPE> <ELEMENT_ID>": "<CALLBACK_FUNTION>"}`

E.g.

`events: {'keypress #new-todo': 'createTodoOnEnter'}`

in jQuery it would be something like:

`$('#new-todo').keypress(createTodoOnEnter);`


## Todo View

Now back to our Todo application: We need a view that renders each of the todo model objects into the page. The `item-template` and `app.TodoView` will generate each todo item.

{% codeblock item-template lang:html https://raw.github.com/amejiarosario/Backbone-tutorial/fe0efb0fd0c4c3c4cb5fd61e9917165082f9a562/backbone-tutorial.html Full Code %}

    <script type="text/template" id="item-template">
      <div class="view">
        <input class="toggle" type="checkbox">
        <label><%- title %></label>
      </div>
    </script>

{% endcodeblock%}

In the following block of code, we have the Backbone.View which uses the above template (`#item-template`) to fill out the title from the `model` we pass along.

{% codeblock Todo View lang:js https://raw.github.com/amejiarosario/Backbone-tutorial/fe0efb0fd0c4c3c4cb5fd61e9917165082f9a562/backbone-tutorial.html Full Code %}

    // renders individual todo items list (li)
    app.TodoView = Backbone.View.extend({
      tagName: 'li',
      template: _.template($('#item-template').html()),
      render: function(){
        this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()));
        return this; // enable chained calls
      }
    });

{% endcodeblock %}

When we instantiate a Backbone View, it can receive any parameter that we need. In this case, since we call the parameter `model` let's instantiate it with a Backbone Model (e.g. todo):

`var view = new app.TodoView({model: todo});`

Also, notice that our view uses a `tagName: li` instead of just `el` from before. This means that the new rendered elements will be wrapped around a `<li></li>`

## Backbone.Events

This module can be mixed with any object and give it the pub/sub (observer pattern) behavior. Events provide a couple of methods from which we will discuss: `on`, `off` and `trigger`. (If this you are familiar with, then in jQuery, they will work the same way + some excellent built-in features)

**Subscribing to Events with on**
`object.on(event, callback, [context])`

Also called bind. It binds an object to an event and a callback. When that event it's triggered, it executes the callback.

E.g.
`todoList.on('add', this.addAll, this);`

Every time a new item is `add`ed to a Backbone.Collection the built-in event `add` ([docs for add](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-add) is triggered. In the example above, after the custom event is triggered, the todoList's callback `addAll()` is executed. Also, the current object is passed with `this` as a `context`.

Events can also be set on arbitrary objects using underscore.js `extend` function:

{% codeblock lang:js %}
var object = {},
    callback = function(msg) { console.log("Triggered " + msg); };

_.extend(object, Backbone.Events);

object.on("my_event", callback);

object.trigger("my_event", "my custom event");
{% endcodeblock %}

## App View

Now, we need another view that takes a collection and renders each of the individual items. We are going to call it â€˜AppViewâ€™. This is a new large chunk of code so read it closely. Please take a look through this code and identify each of the elements.

{% codeblock Todo View lang:js https://raw.github.com/amejiarosario/Backbone-tutorial/fe0efb0fd0c4c3c4cb5fd61e9917165082f9a562/backbone-tutorial.html Full Code %}

    // renders the full list of todo items calling TodoView for each one.
    app.AppView = Backbone.View.extend({
      el: '#todoapp',
      initialize: function () {
        this.input = this.$('#new-todo');

        // instance of the Collection
        app.todoList = new app.TodoList();

        // when new elements are added to the collection render then with addOne
        app.todoList.on('add', this.addOne, this);
        app.todoList.on('reset', this.addAll, this);
        app.todoList.fetch(); // Loads list from local storage
      },
      events: {
        'keypress #new-todo': 'createTodoOnEnter'
      },
      createTodoOnEnter: function(e){
        if ( e.which !== 13 || !this.input.val().trim() ) { // ENTER_KEY = 13
          return;
        }
        app.todoList.create(this.newAttributes());
        this.input.val(''); // clean input box
      },
      addOne: function(todo){
        var view = new app.TodoView({model: todo});
        $('#todo-list').append(view.render().el);
      },
      addAll: function(){
        this.$('#todo-list').html(''); // clean the todo list
        app.todoList.each(this.addOne, this);
      },
      newAttributes: function(){
        return {
          title: this.input.val().trim(),
          completed: false
        }
      }
    });

    //--------------
    // Initializers
    //--------------

    app.appView = new app.AppView();
