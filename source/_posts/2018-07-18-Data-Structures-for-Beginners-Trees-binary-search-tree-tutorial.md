Tree data structures have many uses, and it's good to have a basic understanding of how they work. Trees are the basis for other very used data structures like Maps and Sets. Also, they are used on databases to perform quick searches. The HTML DOM uses a tree data structure to represents the hierarchy of elements.  This post will explore the different types of trees like binary trees, binary search trees, and how to implement them.

We explored [Graph data structures](/blog/2018/05/14/Data-Structures-for-Beginners-Graphs-Time-Complexity-tutorial/) in the previous post, which are a generalized case of trees. Let's get started learning what tree data structures are!

## Trees: basic concepts

A tree is a data structure where a node can have zero or more children. Each node contains a **value**. Like graphs, the connection between nodes is called **edges**. A tree is a type of graph, but not all graphs are trees (more on that later).

These data structures are called "trees" because the data structure resembles a tree 🌳. It starts with a **root** node and **branch** off with its descendants, and finally, there are **leaves**.

<!-- { img https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_tree.jpg Tree } -->
<!-- { img http://www.i-programmer.info/images/stories/BabBag/trees/Tree1.jpg Tree elements } -->

{% img /images/tree-parts.jpg %}

Here are some properties of trees:

- The top-most node is called **root**.
- A node without children is called **leaf** node or **terminal** node.
- **Height** (*h*) of the tree is the distance (edge count) between the farthest leaf to the root.
  - `A` has a height of 3
  - `I` has a height of 0
- **Depth** or **level** of a node is the distance between the root and the node in question.
  - `H` has a depth of 2
  - `B` has a depth of 1

### Implementing a simple tree data structure

As we saw earlier, a tree node is just a data structure with a value and links to its descendants.

Here's an example of a tree node:

```js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.descendants = [];
  }
}
```

We can create a tree with 3 descendants as follows:

```js
// create nodes with values
const abe = new TreeNode('Abe');
const homer = new TreeNode('Homer');
const bart = new TreeNode('Bart');
const lisa = new TreeNode('Lisa');
const maggie = new TreeNode('Maggie');

// associate root with is descendants
abe.descendants.push(homer);
homer.descendants.push(bart, lisa, maggie);
```

That's all; we have a tree data structure!

{% img /images/simpson2-tree.jpg "Simpson tree data structure" %}

The node `abe` is the **root** and `bart`, `lisa` and `maggie` are the **leaf** nodes of the tree. Notice that the tree's node can have different descendants: 0, 1, 3, or any other value.

Tree data structures have many applications such as:

<!-- - Searching in a time complexity of *O(log n)*. -->
<!-- - Cryptography: [Generate pseudorandom numbers](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall07/cos433/prf_goldreich.pdf) -->
- [Maps](https://adrianmejia.com/blog/2018/04/28/data-structures-time-complexity-for-beginners-arrays-hashmaps-linked-lists-stacks-queues-tutorial/#HashMaps)
- [Sets](https://adrianmejia.com/blog/2018/04/28/data-structures-time-complexity-for-beginners-arrays-hashmaps-linked-lists-stacks-queues-tutorial/#Sets)
- Databases
- Priority Queues
- Querying an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- Representing the Document Object Model (DOM) for HTML on Websites.

## Binary Trees

Trees nodes can have zero or more children. However, when a tree has at the most two children, then it's called **binary tree**.

### Full, Complete, and Perfect binary trees

Depending on how nodes are arranged in a binary tree, it can be **full**, **complete** and **perfect**:

- **Full binary tree**: each node has exactly 0 or 2 children (but never 1).
- **Complete binary tree**: when all levels except the last one are **full** with nodes.
- **Perfect binary tree**: when all the levels (including the last one) are full of nodes.

<!-- If each node has only two children (left and right), we call it **Binary Tree**. -->

<!-- A binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children then it said to be a **full binary tree** -->

<!-- When a binary is perfect and comple, it is called a **Perfect Binary Tree**. -->
<!-- { img http://www.csie.ntnu.edu.tw/~u91029/BinaryTree2.png full Binary Tree } -->

<!-- **Complete binary tree** is when all levels except the last one are filled with nodes. -->


<!-- You can also have a combination of full and complete binary trees: -->
<!-- { img https://gsourcecode.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/complete-full-trees1.png "Complete/Full binary tree" } -->

Look at these examples:

{% img /images/full-complete-perfect-binary-tree.jpg Full vs. Complete vs. Perfect Binary Tree %}

These properties are not always mutually exclusive. You can have more than one:

- A perfect tree is **always** complete and full.
  - Perfect binary trees have precisely \`2^k - 1\` nodes, where *`k`* is the last level of the tree (starting with 1).
- A complete tree is **not** always `full`.
  - Like in our "complete" example, since it has a parent with only one child. If we remove the rightmost gray node, then we would have a **complete** and **full** tree but not perfect.
- A full tree is not always complete and perfect.

<!-- If each non-leaf node on a binary tree has two descendants, then we say it is a **complete tree** -->

<!-- { img https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Trees/pix/full_complete.bmp caption } -->

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

Binary Search Trees or BST for short are a particular application of binary trees. BST has at most two nodes (like all binary trees). However, the values are so that the left children value must be less than the parent, and the right children must be higher.

<!-- ---BST vs non-BST--- -->

**Duplicates:** Some BST doesn't allow duplicates while others add the same values as a right child. Other implementations might keep a count on a case of duplicity (we are going to do this one later).

Let's implement a Binary Search Tree!

### BST Implementation

BST are very similar to our previous [implementation of a tree](#Implementing-a-simple-tree-data-structure). However, there are some differences:

- Nodes can have, at most, only two children: left and right.
- Nodes values has to be ordered as `left < parent < right`.

Here's the tree node. Very similar to what we did before, but we added some handy getters and setters for left and right children. Notice is also keeping a reference to the parent, and we update it every time we add children.

{% codeblock TreeNode.js lang:js mark:1-2,8,12,16,18,23,27,29 https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/tree-node.js Code %}
const LEFT = 0;
const RIGHT = 1;

class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.descendants = [];
    this.parent = null;
  }

  get left() {
    return this.descendants[LEFT];
  }

  set left(node) {
    this.descendants[LEFT] = node;
    if (node) {
      node.parent = this;
    }
  }

  get right() {
    return this.descendants[RIGHT];
  }

  set right(node) {
    this.descendants[RIGHT] = node;
    if (node) {
      node.parent = this;
    }
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Ok, so far, we can add a left and right child. Now, let's do the BST class that enforces the `left < parent < right` rule.

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.js lang:js linkUrl linkText %}

class BinarySearchTree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  add(value) { /* ... */ }
  find(value) { /* ... */ }
  remove(value) { /* ... */ }
  getMax() { /* ... */ }
  getMin() { /* ... */ }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Let's implementing insertion.

### BST Node Insertion

To insert a node in a binary tree, we do the following:

1. If a tree is empty, the first node becomes the **root**, and you are done.
1. Compare root/parent's value if it's *higher* go **right**, if it's *lower* go **left**. If it's the same, then the value already exists so that you can increase the duplicate count (multiplicity).
1. Repeat #2 until we found an empty slot to insert the new node.

Let's do an illustration how to insert 30, 40, 10, 15, 12, 50:
{% img /images/bst2.gif "Inserting nodes on a Binary Search Tree (BST)" %}

We can implement insert as follows:

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.add lang:js mark:5,7 https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js#L11 Full Code %}
  add(value) {
    const newNode = new TreeNode(value);

    if (this.root) {
      const { found, parent } = this.findNodeAndParent(value);
      if (found) { // duplicated: value already exist on the tree
        found.meta.multiplicity = (found.meta.multiplicity || 1) + 1;
      } else if (value < parent.value) {
        parent.left = newNode;
      } else {
        parent.right = newNode;
      }
    } else {
      this.root = newNode;
    }

    this.size += 1;
    return newNode;
  }
{% endcodeblock %}

We are using a helper function called `findNodeAndParent`. If we found that the node already exists in the tree, then we increase the `multiplicity` counter. Let's see how this function is implemented:

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.findNodeAndParent lang:js mark:2,10 https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js#L44 Full Code %}
  findNodeAndParent(value) {
    let node = this.root;
    let parent;

    while (node) {
      if (node.value === value) {
        break;
      }
      parent = node;
      node = ( value >= node.value) ? node.right : node.left;
    }

    return { found: node, parent };
  }
{% endcodeblock %}

`findNodeAndParent` goes through the tree, searching for the value. It starts at the root (line 2) and then goes left or right based on the value (line 10). If the value already exists, it will return the node `found` and also the parent. In case that the node doesn't exist, we still return the `parent`.

### BST Node Deletion

We know how to insert and search for value. Now, we are going to implement the delete operation. It's a little trickier than adding, so let's explain it with the following cases:

**Deleting a leaf node (0 children)**

```
    30                             30
 /     \         remove(12)     /     \
10      40       --------->    10      40
  \    /  \                      \    /  \
  15  35   50                    15  35   50
  /
12*
```
We remove the reference from the node's parent (15) to be null.

**Deleting a node with one child.**

```
    30                              30
 /     \         remove(10)      /     \
10*     40       --------->     15      40
  \    /  \                            /  \
  15  35   50                         35   50
```

In this case, we go to the parent (30) and replace the child (10) with a child's child (15).

**Deleting a node with two children**

```
    30                              30
 /     \         remove(40)      /     \
15      40*      --------->     15      50
       /  \                            /
      35   50                         35
```

We are removing node 40, which has two children (35 and 50). We replace the parent's (30) child (40) with the child's right child (50). Then we keep the left child (35) in the same place before, so we have to make it the left child of 50.

Another way to remove node 40 is to move the left child (35) up and then keep the right child (50) where it was.

```
     30
  /     \
 15      35
           \
            50
```

Either way is ok as long as you keep the binary search tree property: `left < parent < right`.

**Deleting the root.**

```
    30*                            50
  /     \       remove(30)        /
 15      50     --------->       35
        /                       /
       35                      15
```

Deleting the root is very similar to removing nodes with 0, 1, or 2 children discussed earlier. The only difference is that afterward, we need to update the reference of the root of the tree.


Here's an animation of what we discussed.

{% img /images/bst-remove.gif Removing a node with 0, 1, 2 children from a binary search tree %}

The animation moves up the left child/subtree and keeps the right child/subtree in place.

Now that we have a good idea how it should work, let's implement it:

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.remove lang:js mark:3,6,12,18 https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js#L89 Full Code %}
  remove(value) {
    const nodeToRemove = this.find(value);
    if (!nodeToRemove) return false;

    // Combine left and right children into one subtree without nodeToRemove
    const nodeToRemoveChildren = this.combineLeftIntoRightSubtree(nodeToRemove);

    if (nodeToRemove.meta.multiplicity && nodeToRemove.meta.multiplicity > 1) {
      nodeToRemove.meta.multiplicity -= 1; // handle duplicated
    } else if (nodeToRemove === this.root) {
      // Replace (root) node to delete with the combined subtree.
      this.root = nodeToRemoveChildren;
      this.root.parent = null; // clearing up old parent
    } else {
      const side = nodeToRemove.isParentLeftChild ? 'left' : 'right';
      const { parent } = nodeToRemove; // get parent
      // Replace node to delete with the combined subtree.
      parent[side] = nodeToRemoveChildren;
    }

    this.size -= 1;
    return true;
  }
{% endcodeblock %}

Here are some highlights of the implementation:

- First, we search if the node exists. If it doesn't, we return false, and we are done!
- If the node to remove exists, then combine left and right children into one subtree.
- Replace node to delete with the combined subtree.

The function that combines left into right subtree is the following:

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.combineLeftIntoRightSubtree lang:js mark:3 https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js#L89 Full Code %}
  combineLeftIntoRightSubtree(node) {
    if (node.right) {
      const leftmost = this.getLeftmost(node.right);
      leftmost.left = node.left;
      return node.right;
    }
    return node.left;
  }
{% endcodeblock %}

For instance, let's say that we want to combine the following tree, and we are about to delete node `30`. We want to mix the 30's left subtree into the right one. The result is this:

```
      30*                             40
    /     \                          /  \
   10      40    combine(30)       35   50
     \    /  \   ----------->      /
     15  35   50                  10
                                   \
                                    15
```

If we make the new subtree the root, then node `30` is no more!

## Binary Tree Transversal

There are different ways of traversing a Binary Tree, depending on the order that the nodes are visited: in-order, pre-order, and post-order. Also, we can use them
[DFS](/blog/2018/05/14/Data-Structures-for-Beginners-Graphs-Time-Complexity-tutorial/#Depth-first-search-DFS-Graph-search)
and
[BFS](/blog/2018/05/14/Data-Structures-for-Beginners-Graphs-Time-Complexity-tutorial/#Breadth-frirst-search-BFS-Graph-search)
that we learned from the
[graph post.](/blog/2018/05/14/Data-Structures-for-Beginners-Graphs-Time-Complexity-tutorial/)
Let's go through each one.

**In-Order Traversal**

In-order traversal visit nodes on this order: left, parent, right.

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.inOrderTraversal lang:js https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js Full Code %}
  * inOrderTraversal(node = this.root) {
    if (node.left) { yield* this.inOrderTraversal(node.left); }
    yield node;
    if (node.right) { yield* this.inOrderTraversal(node.right); }
  }
{% endcodeblock %}


Let's use this tree to make the example:

```
           10
         /    \
        5      30
      /       /  \
     4       15   40
   /
  3
```

In-order traversal would print out the following values: `3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 30, 40`. If the tree is a BST, then the nodes will be sorted in ascendent order as in our example.

**Post-Order Traversal**

Post-order traversal visit nodes on this order: left, right, parent.

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.postOrderTraversal lang:js https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js Full Code %}
  * postOrderTraversal(node = this.root) {
    if (node.left) { yield* this.postOrderTraversal(node.left); }
    if (node.right) { yield* this.postOrderTraversal(node.right); }
    yield node;
  }
{% endcodeblock %}

Post-order traversal would print out the following values: `3, 4, 5, 15, 40, 30, 10`.

**Pre-Order Traversal and DFS**

Pre-order traversal visit nodes on this order: parent, left, right.

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.preOrderTraversal lang:js https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js Full Code %}
  * preOrderTraversal(node = this.root) {
    yield node;
    if (node.left) { yield* this.preOrderTraversal(node.left); }
    if (node.right) { yield* this.preOrderTraversal(node.right); }
  }
{% endcodeblock %}

Pre-order traversal would print out the following values: `10, 5, 4, 3, 30, 15, 40`. This order of numbers is the same result that we would get if we run the Depth-First Search (DFS).

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.dfs lang:js https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js Full Code %}
  * dfs() {
    const stack = new Stack();

    stack.add(this.root);

    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
      const node = stack.remove();
      yield node;
      // reverse array, so left gets removed before right
      node.descendants.reverse().forEach(child => stack.add(child));
    }
  }
{% endcodeblock %}

If you need a refresher on DFS, we covered it in detail on [Graph post](/blog/2018/05/14/Data-Structures-for-Beginners-Graphs-Time-Complexity-tutorial/#Depth-first-search-DFS-Graph-search).

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

Similar to DFS, we can implement a BFS by switching the `Stack` by a `Queue`:

{% codeblock BinarySearchTree.prototype.bfs lang:js https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js/blob/master/src/data-structures/trees/binary-search-tree.js Full Code %}
  * bfs() {
    const queue = new Queue();

    queue.add(this.root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
      const node = queue.remove();
      yield node;
      node.descendants.forEach(child => queue.add(child));
    }
  }
{% endcodeblock %}

The BFS order is: `10, 5, 30, 4, 15, 40, 3`

## Balanced vs. Non-balanced Trees

So far, we have discussed how to `add`, `remove`, and `find` elements. However, we haven't talked about runtimes. Let's think about the worst-case scenarios.

Let's say that we want to add numbers in ascending order.

{% img /images/bst-asc.gif Inserting values in ascending order in a Binary Search Tree %}

We will end up with all the nodes on the right side! This unbalanced tree is no better than a LinkedList, so finding an element would take *O(n)*. 😱

Looking for something in an unbalanced tree is like looking for a word in the dictionary page by page. When the tree is balanced, you can open the dictionary in the middle, and from there, you know if you have to go left or right depending on the alphabet and the word you are looking for.

We need to find a way to balance the tree!

If the tree was **balanced**, we could find elements in *O(log n)* instead of going through each node. Let's talk about what a balanced tree means.

<!-- { img http://www.stoimen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/3.-Balanced-vs.-Non-Balanced.png Balanced vs unbalanced Tree } -->
{% img /images/balanced-vs-non-balanced-tree.jpg Balanced vs unbalanced Tree %}

If we search for `7` in the non-balanced tree, we have to go from 1 to 7. However, in the balanced tree, we visit: `4`, `6`, and `7`. It gets even worse with larger trees. If you have one million nodes, searching for a non-existing element might require you to visit all million while on a balanced tree. It just needs 20 visits! That's a huge difference!

We are going to solve this issue in the next post using self-balanced trees (AVL trees).

## Summary

We have covered much ground for trees. Let's sum it up with bullets:

- The tree is a data structure where a node has 0 or more descendants/children.
- Tree nodes don't have cycles (acyclic). If it has cycles, it is a [Graph data structure](/blog/2018/05/14/Data-Structures-for-Beginners-Graphs-Time-Complexity-tutorial/) instead.
- Trees with two children or less are called: Binary Tree
- When a Binary Tree is sorted so that the left value is less than the parent and the right children is higher, then and only then we have a **Binary Search Tree**.
- You can visit a tree in a pre/post/in-order fashion.
- An unbalanced has a time complexity of *O(n)*. 🤦🏻‍
- A balanced has a time complexity of *O(log n)*. 🎉
