The advantages of different presentation media are explored in the work of N. Hashim and S. Salam in “Integration of Visualization Techniques and Completion Strategy to Improve Learning in Computer Programming” [1]. They compare the advantages of Mobile-based training (MBT) over Web-based training (WBT) for learning computer programming. Additionally, they explain some features that aid the learning process, such as visualization techniques and completion strategy. Visualization techniques refers to the use of static (images and text) and dynamic (animation, voice and videos) presentation. Completion strategy is an assessment technique in which the learner have to prove their knowledge gained. This is done by filling blanks of incomplete code snippets, rewrite programs to improve performance, and so forth.
