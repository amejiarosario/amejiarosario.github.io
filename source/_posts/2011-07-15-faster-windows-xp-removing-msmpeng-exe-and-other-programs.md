<p>At work, I use an Windows XP machine and it some times get really slowly. I noticed from the task manager (ctrl+shift+esc) that the process MsMpEng.exe is consuming most of my CPU time!</p>
<p><strong>MsMpEng.exe</strong> is a process associated to <em>Windows Defender</em> that help you to "<em>protected</em>" the computer, but sometimes it requires too much resources. So, if eating up your available CPU it is better to disable it.</p>
<!--More-->
<p>Disable <strong>MsMpEng.exe</strong>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>start menu -&gt; <strong>run&nbsp; </strong>(windows key + r)</li>
	<li>write <strong>services.msc</strong> and enter</li>
	<li><strong>Stop </strong>the following services: "Microsoft Forefront Client Security Antimalware Service" and "Microsoft Forefront Client Security State Assessment Service" doing a right click.</li>
	<li>Set the "Startup Type"&nbsp; to "Manual" of both services doing double click on them.</li>
	<li>You can repeate the same steps 1-4 to remove safely services, like "Indexing Service" which slow down your computer, too. And memory consuming processes.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enjoy a faster computer!</li>
