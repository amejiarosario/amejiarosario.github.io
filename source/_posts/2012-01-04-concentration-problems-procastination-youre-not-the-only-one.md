<p>Procastination and concentration problems are big deals from a lot of people, specially for students. There are too many distractions that are more fun than our homework.</p>

<p>I read an interesting&nbsp;<a href="http://altmedicine.about.com/od/optimumhealthessentials/a/Concentration.htm">article about concentration</a>&nbsp;that I&#39;d like to share a summary with my own notes:</p>
<p>There is no substitute for paying attention... here are Five tips to improve your attention/concentration/focus/productivity:</p>
<p><strong>F =&nbsp;</strong><u><strong>Five More Rule</strong></u></p>

	There are two kinds of people -- those who have learned how to work through frustration, and those who wish they had. From now on, if you&#39;re in the middle of a task and tempted to give up -- just do 5 MORE. Read 5 MORE pages. Finish 5 MORE math problems. Work 5 MORE minutes.</div>

		Don&#39;t feel like concentrating? Are you putting off a task or project you&#39;re supposed to be working on? That&#39;s a form of procrastination. R. D. Clyde said, &quot;It&#39;s amazing how long it takes to complete something we&#39;re not working on.&quot; ~ Every time you catch yourself doing something that you are not suppose to be doing (facebook, twitter, 9gag) quite it right away, and get back to your homework/work.</div>

		Give multi-tasking a rest. Focus in one task at time!</div>
	<div>

	<div>
		<strong>S =&nbsp;<u>See As If For the First or Last Time</u></strong></div>

		uhm... maybe not very useful but it says: Want to know how to be &quot;here and now&quot; and fully present instead of mindlessly rushing here, there, and everywhere? Frederick Franck said, &quot;When the eye wakes up to see again, it suddenly stops taking anything for granted.&quot; Evelyn Underhill said, &quot;For lack of attention, a thousand forms of loveliness elude us every day.&quot;</div>
